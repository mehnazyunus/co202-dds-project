             DATA ENCRYPTION USING XOR
By: Mehnaz Yunus(16CO124)  and Ramya B(16C0239)
This project simulates a circuit where data can be encrypted using symmetric key and where the key changes for every encryption. It displays the encrypted data and decrypted data.

USER MANUAL FOR VERILOG -
1.Open terminal.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CIRCUIT USING BEHAVIORAL MODEL.
2.Type the command “iverilog -o test.vvp VerilogBM-124-239.v  Verilog-124-239.v” 
3.Now type, test.vvp
4.The user input which is varied in the test bench, key which is generated by the designed circuit, encrypted data and the decrypted data is displayed on the output screen.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CIRCUIT USING DATAFLOW MODEL.
5.Type the command “iverilog -o test.vvp VerilogDM-124-239.v Verilog-124-239.v” 
6.Now type, test.vvp
7.The user input which is varied in the test bench, key which is generated by the designed circuit, encrypted data and the decrypted data is displayed on the output screen.

8.If you would like to give your own inputs and test the encryption and decryption, open the test bench file(Verilog-124-239.v) and assign your desired input to data.


The update rule for key generation "Rule 30" can be expressed as a Boolean formula:
Next State = A exclusive-or (B or C)
